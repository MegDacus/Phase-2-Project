Welcome to the Animal Adoption Website! 

To start the app, you'll need to run 'npm run server' in one terminal and 'npm start' in seperate terminal. 

To adopt an animal, simply head to the "Available {insert animal type here}" page and select "Adopt Me". 
If you're interested in adopting, but not ready to commit, select the "Enquire" button and send us an email through our "Contact Us" page.

For proof of your adoption, you can head to the "Adopted Animals" page for a list(with images!) of all the previously adopted animals and the date they were adopted. 

Enjoy!
